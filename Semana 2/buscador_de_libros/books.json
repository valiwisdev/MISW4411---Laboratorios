        "description": "The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. It's a story of lavish parties on Long Island at a time when the American economy was soaring. The novel is narrated by Nick Carraway, a young man from Minnesota who moves to New York in the summer of 1922 to learn about the bond business. He rents a house in the West Egg district of Long Island, a wealthy but unfashionable area populated by the new rich, across the bay from the fashionable, established-money East Egg. Nick’s neighbor in West Egg is a mysterious man named Jay Gatsby, who lives in a gigantic Gothic mansion and throws extravagant parties every Saturday night."

        "author": "Harper Lee",
        "description": "The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it, To Kill A Mockingbird became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic. Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature. The story is told by the six-year-old Jean Louise Finch, and it is a story about the trial of a black man accused of raping a white woman."

        "author": "George Orwell",
        "description": "Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmare vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life—the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language—and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written. The story is set in Airstrip One, a province of the superstate Oceania, in a world of perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, and public manipulation. The superstate and its residents are dictated by a political regime euphemistically named English Socialism, shortened to 'Ingsoc' in Newspeak, the government's invented language. The superstate is under the control of the privileged elite of the Inner Party, a party and government that persecutes individualism and independent thinking as 'thoughtcrime,' which is enforced by the 'Thought Police.'"

        "author": "Jane Austen",
        "description": "Since its immediate success in 1813, Pride and Prejudice has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work her 'own darling child' and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, 'as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print.' The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England. The story follows the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as she deals with issues of manners, upbringing, morality, education, and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of the British Regency. Elizabeth is the second of five daughters of a country gentleman living near the fictional town of Meryton in Hertfordshire, near London. Set in England in the early 19th century, Pride and Prejudice tells the story of Mr and Mrs Bennet's five unmarried daughters after the rich and eligible Mr Bingley and his status-conscious friend, Mr Darcy, have moved into their neighbourhood."

        "description": "The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most classic works, the novel has been the subject of controversy and debate since its publication. The story is narrated by Holden Caulfield, a teenager who has been expelled from Pencey Prep, a preparatory school."

        "author": "Erik Brynjolfsson & Andrew McAfee",
        "description": "This influential book explores how digital technologies, particularly AI, are fundamentally changing our economy. The authors argue that we are at an inflection point where these technologies are accelerating progress, creating wealth, but also causing significant societal challenges. They analyze the dual effects of 'bounty' (more wealth and options) and 'spread' (growing inequality between high-skilled and low-skilled workers). The book discusses the economic phenomena of job polarization and the hollowing out of the middle class, urging for policy changes in education and social safety nets."

        "title": "Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy",
        "author": "Cathy O'Neil",
        "description": "A data scientist and mathematician, O'Neil reveals how the mathematical models and algorithms that underpin AI are not neutral. She argues that these models, often opaque, unregulated, and unaccountable, can embed human biases and automate discrimination. The book provides numerous real-world examples, from how AI is used in hiring and credit scoring to policing and education, showing how these 'weapons of math destruction' can reinforce existing social and economic inequalities and undermine democratic principles. It is a powerful call for greater transparency and ethical oversight."

        "title": "Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control",
        "author": "Stuart Russell",
        "description": "Written by a leading AI researcher and co-author of the standard AI textbook, this book tackles the fundamental problem of ensuring that increasingly powerful AI systems remain beneficial for humans. Russell argues that the current approach of optimizing for fixed objectives is flawed and dangerous. He proposes a new model for AI based on machines that are provably deferential to humans, uncertain about human preferences, and learn from human behavior. The book is a crucial examination of the economic and social necessity of solving the AI control problem to ensure a prosperous future."

        "title": "The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values",
        "author": "Brian Christian",
        "description": "This book offers an insightful and accessible exploration of one of AI's most critical challenges: ensuring that machine learning systems understand and act in accordance with human values. Christian delves into the technical and ethical dimensions of the 'alignment problem,' covering topics like fairness, interpretability, and how to avoid unintended consequences in algorithms. He connects the abstract challenges of AI alignment to real-world socioeconomic problems, such as algorithmic bias in criminal justice and content curation on social media, making a complex topic understandable and urgent."

        "title": "Power and Progress: Our Thousand-Year Struggle Over Technology and Prosperity",
        "author": "Daron Acemoglu & Simon Johnson",
        "description": "Two leading economists challenge the techno-optimist narrative that new technologies, including AI, will automatically lead to widespread prosperity. Drawing on a thousand years of history, they argue that the social and economic benefits of technology are not automatic; they are determined by the choices made by those in power. The book contends that the current trajectory of AI is focused on automation and surveillance, which benefits a narrow elite. They advocate for a change in direction to augment human capabilities and create a more equitable distribution of the gains from technological progress."

        "title": "A World Without Work: Technology, Automation, and How We Should Respond",
        "author": "Daniel Susskind",
        "description": "Economist Daniel Susskind confronts the prospect of a future where technology and AI replace a significant amount of human work. He systematically dismantles the common argument that technology always creates new jobs to replace old ones, suggesting that this time may be different. The book explores the profound economic and social consequences of a 'world without work,' including the roles of meaning, purpose, and income. Susskind discusses potential policy responses, such as Universal Basic Income (UBI), and the need for a stronger state to manage leisure, taxation, and power in an automated age."
